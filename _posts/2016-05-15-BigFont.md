To support an NLog wrapper I've been working on, I needed a way to print text to the console and to a log file in a more conspicuous way.  To achieve this goal I've created BigFont.cs for C#.

The class is extremely simple, consisting of about 6 lines of actual code:

```c#
/// <summary>
/// Generates a large string of characters corresponding to the input phrase.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Any character that doesn't exist in the alphabet will be replaced with a question mark.
/// </remarks>
/// <param name="phrase">The phrase to generate.</param>
/// <param name="size">The size of the font to use.</param>
/// <returns>A string array containing the generated output.</returns>
public static string[] Generate(string phrase, FontSize size = FontSize.Large)
{
    string[] r = new string[(int)size];

    foreach (char c in phrase.ToUpper())
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)size; i++)
            r[i] += Alphabet[new Tuple<char, FontSize>((Alphabet.ContainsKey(new Tuple<char, FontSize>(c, size)) ? c : '?'), size)][i];

    return r;
}
```
