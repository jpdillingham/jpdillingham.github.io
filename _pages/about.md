Dillingham.ws is a small personal blog on which I can share my projects and expertise with others.

My first exposure to programming was in the early 90's using [QBasic](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/QBasic) as part of a summer enrichment program at a local community college. At the time I didn't quite understand what I was doing but I found the premise fun.  I also took a class in Russian that summer but all I remember is how I hid in the bleachers while the rest of the class went in front of everyone during the final assembly and did a cultural dance. I'd do the same today in a simular situation.

My modern programming experience began shortly after I purchased my first "real", internet-capable computer in 1999.  I was immediately drawn to [IRC](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Internet_Relay_Chat) by the premise of anonymously trash-talking strangers thousands of miles away, however after novelty of this wore off I soon developed real friendships with a diverse group of people.  Along with IRC came the mIRC client software, which has a fairly expansive pseudo-functional-pseudo-event-driven [scripting language](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MIRC_scripting_language).

I began to explore the language and, since I had recently graduated high school, had no girlfriend and was working part time at a RadioShack, I had a TON of spare time on my hands.  Over the next two years I generated tens of thousands of lines of code on hundreds of different projects ranging from an FTP client to an XML parser to a Sokoban game.  On days I didn't work I would regularly program from the time I woke up to the time I went to sleep, sometimes well over 24 hours later.

During the latter part of this time I began to become interested in other programming languages, primarily [Visual Basic 6](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Visual_Basic) and web-based languages like [PHP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PHP), HTML and JavaScript.  My experimentation with these languages and the exposure to some of the things "real" programmers could do led me to the conclusion that I, myself was destined to become a "real" programmer.  Somewhere around 2002 I enrolled at Southeastern Community College (the same at which I had attended my first programming course) with the intent of becoming a programmer.
